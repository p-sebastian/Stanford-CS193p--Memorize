/*
 ** HOW H/V/Z Stacks layout themselves **
 the stacks first take the available size provided by their container
 then begin to assign a size to each of their subviews, starting with
 the LEAST flexible view, such as Image which requires a fixed size,
 after that it goes to the next least flexible until it finishes all the views,
 after all their views have their size allocated, the stack then resizes itself
 to fit it
 (this priority can be modified with `.layoutPriority()`
